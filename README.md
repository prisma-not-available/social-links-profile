## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned  

I learned that there is a thing called "Mobile-first approach" since i mostly worked with desktop view and did not bother on responsiveness of the website, so i also learned or have some ideas about media queries which i did not get a chance to apply in this one, but i practiced it using another html file and it went great.

### Continued development

I want to focus more on accessibility and responsive design and deep dive into media queries.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - This helped me for styling. there are some properties that i keep forgetting like flexbox properties and this website is my go-to everytime. i recommend this to anyone who is also starting in web development or in technology in general like me.
